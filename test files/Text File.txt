1. Given the
2. challenging fiscal environment,
3. identifying potential opportunities for efficiencies and
4. cost savings in commissaries and exchanges can help DOD
5. manage programs in the face of potential budget reductions.
6. Although DOD’s report states that DOD will not be able to achieve
7. budget neutrality, the report lacks additional detailed information a
8. bout potential trade-offs,
9. constraints and limitations
10. to achieving budget
11. neutrality
12. . In addition, DOD stated
13. in its May 2016 report to
14. Congress that it can achieve an estimated $2 billion
15. in cost savings over a 5-year period, but the department
16. did not provide information on its steps to achieve the
17. cost savings. In addition, DOD’s
18. report does not fully address all of the
19. mandated reporting elements,
20. instead only partially addressing four of the
21. seven elements. DOD does not outline specific
22. metrics, as required for pilot
23. programs authorized under
24. section 651, to maintain
25. high levels of customer satisfaction,
26. quality of products,
27. and patron savings
28. within the commissaries and
29. exchanges. As DOD moves
30. forward with pilot programs,
31. DOD will need specific
32. metrics to meet the
33. requirements of section 651.
34. However, the report
35. does not provide
36. additional information
37. for decision makers in
38. Congress to evaluate how DOD
39. will achieve its estimated reductions
40. in 5 years. In the absence
41. of detailed information
42. to support its conclusion
43. that it cannot achieve
44. budget neutrality,
45. the department lacks
46. assurance that its cost
47. savings target is an accurate
48. and achievable estimate,
49. as well as a plan
50. with a methodology,
51. cost estimates and
52. specific time frames,
53. decisionmakers
54. cannot evaluate
55. whether
56. the implementation
57. of DOD’s efforts are
58. effective in achieving
59. its estimated cost
60. savings without
61. impacting patrons.
